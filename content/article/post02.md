# Post 02 - Arkhi Tips and Tricks

Developing web applications can be a challenging task, especially as the application grows in size and complexity. However, with the right set of tools and techniques, it can be made easier. In this article, we will discover a collection of tips and tricks that can enhance your development workflow when using Arkhi.

1. Use Components Wisely: Components are the building blocks of your application. It is important to use them wisely. Try to make your components as small and as reusable as possible. This will help in creating a clean and maintainable codebase.

2. Manage State Effectively: Managing state in a web application can be challenging. It is important to manage the state of your application in a central place and update it from anywhere in your application. This makes it easy to manage complex state logic and ensures that your application is always in a consistent state.

3. Leverage Server-Side Rendering (SSR): SSR is essential for improving the initial load time of your application and for SEO optimization. With Arkhi, you can easily enable SSR for your application with just a few lines of code.

4. Use Lazy Loading: Lazy loading is a technique that allows you to load parts of your application only when they are needed. This can help in improving the performance of your application, especially on slow networks. Arkhi includes support for lazy loading out of the box.

5. Optimize Your Images: Images can have a significant impact on the performance of your application. It is important to optimize your images before using them in your application. There are several online tools available that can help you in optimizing your images.

6. Use CSS Modules: CSS Modules are a way to have local scope CSS by default. This means that the classes you define in a CSS Module are scoped to the component, not global, which helps prevent styling conflicts.

7. Test Your Application: Testing is a crucial part of the development process. It is important to test your application thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Arkhi includes support for testing out of the box.

In conclusion, developing web applications with Arkhi can be made easier with the right set of tools and techniques. These tips and tricks can help enhance your development workflow and make it more efficient. Give them a try and see how they can help you in your next web development project.
