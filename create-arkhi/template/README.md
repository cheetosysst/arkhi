# Arkhi.js - Islands Architecture based meta-framework

The word "archipelago" originates from the Greek language. It is derived from two Greek words: "arkhi," meaning "chief", and "pelagos", meaning "sea".

Arkhi.js aims to leverage the [Islands Architecture](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/islands-architecture) concept, empowering developers to construct their own archipelago of functionality.
